# Atomic Components Methodology

## Why? (reasons)

### Atomic design
- Reusability
- Easier to create style guide
- Easy to understand layout
- Code consistency
- Do not focus on pixel-perfect designs
- Efficiency, quicker prototyping
- Easier to update and remove parts
- More modular file structure
- Less components overall

## Elements (What)

- Atoms: native elements. User interface elements of the smallest entity without further breaking down to become the elemental building blocks of the intended interface.
- Molecules: behavioral components. Atoms collected to become relatively simple user interface components.
- Organisms: Domain composition. Complex components forming the discrete sections of the interface.
- Ecosystems: Route. Used to position components on the page layout with a demonstration of the underlying content structure of the design.
- Environment: themes, state, async. Manipulated to apply real content to the preferred templates in demonstrating the final user interface while testing the design system resiliency.
